## **What is Open Source?**

### 1. **Source Code Availability:**

The source code of the software is freely accessible. This allows anyone to inspect how the software works, modify it to suit their needs, and share those modifications with others.

### 2. **Licensing:**

Open source software is typically distributed under licenses that comply with the Open Source Definition. These licenses grant users the rights to use, modify, and distribute the software.

## **Philosophy behind Open Source:**

The main philosophy of open-source products is the freedom to think, create, learn, and share. It is a collaborative effort of many developers who are working together to create something amazing. In the early phases of technology, open source helps the technology to not become handicapped by some big entities and is developed by people who really have the passion to make that piece of technology better.

  - Example: `bugfix/fix-login-issue`
  - Example: `bugfix/correct-calculation-error`

- **Improvement Branches**: For code improvements or refactoring.
  - Example: `improvement/refactor-user-service`
  - Example: `improvement/optimize-db-queries`

- **Hotfix Branches**: For urgent fixes.
  - Example: `hotfix/patch-security-vulnerability`
  - Example: `hotfix/update-dependencies`

---
#### Writing Commit Messages

- **Structure**: Use a short summary, followed by a blank line, and a detailed description if necessary.
  - Example:
    ```
    Short summary (50 characters or less)

    Detailed explanation of the changes, reasons, and references to issues if applicable.
    ```

- **Examples**:
  - **Feature Addition**:
    ```
    Add user authentication feature

    Implement user login and registration with JWT authentication.
    Update the user model and add corresponding routes and tests.
    ```
  - **Bug Fix**:
    ```
    Fix login issue when username contains spaces

    Corrected the regex used for validating usernames to allow spaces.
    Updated the login form to trim whitespace before submission.
    ```
  - **Code Improvement**:
    ```
    Refactor user service for better readability

    Split the user service into smaller functions for better maintainability.
    Add comments and update documentation.
    ```
  - **Hotfix**:
    ```
    Patch security vulnerability in password hashing

    Upgrade the password hashing library to the latest version to address
    the identified vulnerability. Update existing tests to ensure compatibility.
    ```

### Best Practices For Commit Messages

- **Be Clear and Concise**: Summarize the changes in the subject line and provide additional details in the body if necessary.
- **Use the Imperative Mood**: Write the subject line as if you're giving an order, e.g., "Fix bug" instead of "Fixed bug".
- **Reference Issues**: If applicable, reference the issue number that the commit addresses, e.g., "Fix login issue #123".
- **Separate Concerns**: Make sure each commit contains related changes and is not too large. This makes it easier to review and revert if necessary.

## General Guide for Good Code Formatting and Linting

Proper code formatting and linting practices help maintain code quality, readability, and consistency across projects.

Some points to remember for good code consistency and quality:

### 1. Consistent Indentation

- Use spaces for indentation (typically 2 or 4 spaces per indent).
- Choose either spaces or tabs consistently throughout your codebase.
- Configure your editor to automatically convert tabs to spaces.

### 2. Naming Conventions

- Follow language-specific naming conventions (e.g., PEP 8 for Python).
- Use descriptive names for variables, functions, classes, and methods.
- Avoid cryptic abbreviations; favor clarity and readability.

### 3. Line Length and Wrapping

- Limit lines to a maximum of 80-120 characters.
- Break long lines into multiple lines to improve readability.
- Use parentheses for line continuation in languages like Python.

### 4. Code Organization

- Structure code logically with consistent spacing and blank lines.
- Group related functions and classes together.
- Use comments and docstrings to explain complex code sections and functions.

### 5. Consistent Code Style

- Adhere to a consistent code style guide (e.g., PEP 8 for Python, Google Style Guide for JavaScript).
- Use automated tools like linters and formatters to enforce style guidelines.

### 6. Linting Tools

- **Linters**: Use linters to analyze code for potential errors, bugs, and stylistic issues.
  - Examples: `pylint` for Python, `eslint` for JavaScript.
- Configure linters to run automatically on code changes or before commits.

### 7. Automated Formatting

- **Formatters**: Use code formatters to automatically enforce style guidelines and formatting rules.
  - Examples: `black` for Python, `prettier` for JavaScript.
- Integrate formatters into your editor or CI/CD pipeline for consistent formatting.

### 8. Version Control Integration

- Commit formatted code only; avoid mixing formatting changes with functional changes.
- Use Git hooks to automatically run linters and formatters before committing or pushing changes.

### 9. Code Reviews

- Incorporate linting and formatting checks into code review processes.
- Discuss and resolve style inconsistencies as part of code review feedback.

### 10. Continuous Improvement

- Regularly update and refine coding standards based on project needs and community best practices.
- Encourage team members to contribute to and follow code formatting and linting guidelines.

By following these guidelines, you can maintain clean, readable code that enhances collaboration and reduces maintenance overhead in your projects.
